Welcome to the Bopkit tutorials directory! Here, you'll find a collection of
small circuits and tests that serve as a great introduction to the Bopkit
language and simulator.

Browse through the tutorials to get a feel for how the language works and how to
run the simulator from the command line. These examples are designed to be
accessible and easy to follow, making them a perfect first step for newcomers.
