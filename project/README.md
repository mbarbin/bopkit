This project implements a circuit with an output of 42 bits that drives the
display of the 7-segment digits of a digital watch.

Visa is a compact microprocessor that comes with a tool for simulating its
assembly language and converting it into binary instructions for the
visa-machine. The project contains an assembly code that drives the display of a
7-segment digital calendar.

Subleq is a microprocessor implementation with a single instruction (OISC). The
project also features a tool that produces RAM images whose subleq-computation
doesn't loop, which we use as input tests.
