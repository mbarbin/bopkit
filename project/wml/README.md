The project implements a parser, typer, and interpreter chain for a language of
arithmetic expressions named wml, which serves as an educational tool. It was
built based on a compilation course with Professor Patrick Cousot. Additionally,
the project features a hardware design for a stack-machine that is optimized for
running wml programs and comes with a compiler and assembler for it.
