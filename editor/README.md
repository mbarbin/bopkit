In this directory you'll find basic support for some editors. This includes
syntax highlighting and autoformatting.

## Autoformatting

Bopkit comes with a pretty-printer for `*.bop` files, which you can set up for
your editor. If you develop a `bopkit` project, we recommend using `dune` as
the build system. You can checkout the source of bopkit to see how we integrated
this command to `dune fmt`.

NAME
       bopkit-fmt-file - autoformat bopkit files

SYNOPSIS
       bopkit fmt file [OPTION]â€¦ FILE



       This is a pretty-print command for bopkit files (extensions .bop).



       This reads the contents of a file supplied in the command line, and
       pretty-print it on stdout, leaving the original file unchanged.



       If [--read-contents-from-stdin] is supplied, then the contents of the
       file is read from stdin. In this case the filename must still be
       supplied, and will be used for located error messages only.



       In case of syntax errors or other issues, some contents may still be
       printed to stdout, however the exit code will be non zero (typically
       [1]). Errors are printed on stderr.



       The hope for this command is for it to be compatible with editors and
       build systems so that you can integrate autoformatting of files into
       your workflow.



       Because this command has been tested with a vscode extension that
       strips the last newline, a flag has been added to add an extra blank
       line, shall you run into this issue.
