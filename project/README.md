This project implements a circuit with an output of 42 bits that drives the
display of the 7-segment digits of a digital watch.

Visa is a compact micro-processor that comes with a tool for simulating its
assembly language and converting it into binary instructions for the
visa-machine. The project contains an assembly code that drives the display of a
7-segment digital calendar.

## [Subleq](subleq/)

Subleq is a micro-processor implementation with a single instruction (OISC). The
project also features a tool that produces RAM images whose subleq-computation
doesn't loop, which we use as input tests.

## [Wml](wml/)

The project implements a parser, typer, and interpreter chain for a language of
arithmetic expressions named wml, which serves as an educational tool. It was
built based on a compilation course with Professor Patrick Cousot. Additionally,
the project features a hardware design for a stack-machine that is optimized for
running wml programs and comes with a compiler and assembler for it.
