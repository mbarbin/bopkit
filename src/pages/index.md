Welcome to Bopkit, an educational project that provides a description language
for programming synchronous digital circuits.

With Bopkit, you can express synchronous digital circuits, simulate them using
the Bopkit simulator, and convert your designs to standalone C executables or
hierarchical Verilog.

Bopkit also provides an interface for integrating external blocks written in
other languages. For example, you can use OCaml blocks for unit-testing, or
connect your circuits to user-friendly graphical devices such as the Bopboard or
a 7-segment display.
