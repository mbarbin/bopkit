This part of the stdlib implements an graphical user interface in the form of an
external block that can be connected to bopkit circuits. The interface displays
a 7-segment display for a digital watch.

It is used in the
[digital-watch](https://github.com/mbarbin/bopkit/tree/main/project/digital-watch/main.bop)
project.
