# Synthesizing a circuit from a partial specification

Let's go over a second example. This time, the function is only partially
specified. This means that some of the output bits have been left unspecified,
and are marked with the character '*'.

```sh
$ cat starred.txt
101*1*1
01011**
***1011
*010*11
```

This specification file has 4 words, so it could represent a memory of 2 bits of
address, but actually, let's interpret it as the partial specification for a
memory of 4 bits of address. In addition to the bits marked with '*', all the
remaining of the specification is interpreted as unspecified as well.

## Synthesis

Let's synthesize the circuit from this partial specification:

```sh
$ bopkit bdd synthesize --AD 4 --WL 7 -f starred.txt
// Block synthesized by bopkit from "starred.txt"
// Gate count: [105|8|6] (5.714 %)

Block(a:[4]) = out:[7]
with unused = a[2..3]
where
  s1 = Not(a[0]);
  out[0] = Id(s1);
  s2 = Not(a[1]);
  s3 = Mux(a[0], s2, Gnd());
  out[1] = Id(s3);
  s4 = Mux(a[0], a[1], Vdd());
  out[2] = Id(s4);
  s5 = Mux(a[0], s2, Vdd());
  out[3] = Id(s5);
  s6 = Mux(a[0], Vdd(), s2);
  out[4] = Id(s6);
  out[5] = Vdd();
  out[6] = Vdd();
end where;
```

## Testing the synthesized circuit with bopkit bdd checker

### Introducing bopkit bdd checker

This time we'll use a testing program to checks the result of the circuit.
That's what `bopkit bdd checker` is about!

```sh
$ bopkit bdd checker --help=plain
NAME
       bopkit-bdd-checker - external block

SYNOPSIS
       bopkit bdd checker [OPTION]â€¦



       This block takes in a BDD truth table, an address and a result. It
       checks whether the result agrees with the truth table, and if not
       raises an exception. It is meant to be used as unit-test in a bopkit
       simulation.



OPTIONS
       --AD=N (required)
           number of bits of addresses.

       -c N
           stop at cycle N.

       -f FILE (required)
           the file to load.

       --no-input, --ni
           block will read no input.

       --no-output, --no
           block will print no output.

       --verbose
           be more verbose.

       --WL=N (required)
           number of bits of output words.

COMMON OPTIONS
       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of auto,
           pager, groff or plain. With auto, the format is pager or plain
           whenever the TERM env var is dumb or undefined.

       --version
           Show version information.

EXIT STATUS
       bopkit bdd checker exits with:

       0   on success.

       123 on indiscriminate errors reported on standard error.

       124 on command line parsing errors.

       125 on unexpected internal errors (bugs).

SEE ALSO
       bopkit(1)

```

Let's try it manually on an example - the first line of the truth table.

As a reminder this line is:

```sh
$ head -n 1 starred.txt
101*1*1
```

The first 4 bits will be the address of that first line (zero), followed by the
7 bits of the word we'd like to check:

```sh
$ echo '00001011101' | bopkit bdd checker --AD 4 --WL 7 -f starred.txt

```

Now let's try with an invalid input (an invalid bit at the very last position):

```sh
$ echo '00001011100' | bopkit bdd checker --AD 4 --WL 7 -f starred.txt
Conflict for bdd at addr '0000' (0)
Expected = '101*1*1'
Received = '1011100'
("External block exception" ((name bdd-checker) (index_cycle 1))
 ((line 00001011100))
 (TEST_FAILURE ((address 0000) (expected 101*1*1) (received 1011100))))
[1]
```

### Use bdd checker in a circuit

Now we'll plug the checker into a simulation, by connecting it as an external
block. See it done in this file:

<!-- $MDX file=check_starred.bop -->
```bopkit
// We include the file synthesized by `bopkit bdd`.
#include "starred.bop"

/**
 * FILENAME is the image file we had originally. We'll use it to check the
 * output of the circuit thanks to `bopkit bdd checker`.
 */
#define FILENAME "starred.txt"
#define AD 4
#define WL 7

Test(a:[AD]) = ()
where
  // Here we call the synthesized block via the #include which is at the
  // beginning of the file.
  block[1]:[WL] = Block(a:[AD]);

  // Here, just for fun we simulate the synthesized file with another call to
  // the simulator. This is equivalent to the call above. When using the simulator
  // in external blocks, the option [-p] must be added.
  block[2]:[WL] = external("bopkit simu starred-tree.bop -p", a:[AD]);

  // Here we check the result of both blocks with the bdd checker. It would
  // raise an exception and stops the simulation in case of an invalid result.
  for i = 1 to 2
    external("bopkit bdd checker --AD %{AD} --WL %{WL} -f %{FILENAME}",
      a:[AD],
      block[i]:[WL]);
  end for;
end where;
```

And now we just have to let the simulation run through a complete input cycle to
check it all.

```sh
$ bopkit simu check_starred.bop --num-counter-cycle 1
   Cycle | a[0] a[1] a[2] a[3] |
       0 | 0 0 0 0 |
       1 | 1 0 0 0 |
       2 | 0 1 0 0 |
       3 | 1 1 0 0 |
       4 | 0 0 1 0 |
       5 | 1 0 1 0 |
       6 | 0 1 1 0 |
       7 | 1 1 1 0 |
       8 | 0 0 0 1 |
       9 | 1 0 0 1 |
      10 | 0 1 0 1 |
      11 | 1 1 0 1 |
      12 | 0 0 1 1 |
      13 | 1 0 1 1 |
      14 | 0 1 1 1 |
      15 | 1 1 1 1 |
```

The command exited with code [0].
